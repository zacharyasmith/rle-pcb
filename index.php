  <p>RLE Technologies has commissioned the CSU Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering Department to help streamline their PCB testing process. The company has their product's PC boards fabricated offsite and delivered to be assembled inside their fixtures. Before commencing this engineering project, the test procedure they utilized for ensuring proper quality assurance took thirty minutes for only two PC boards. This was no longer acceptable.</p>
  <p>Our team was tasked with developing a new testing procedure to ensure proper functionality for each board. The team, consisting of two mechanical engineers, two electrical engineers, and a computer engineer, will have an apparatus built for testing at least two of their flagship product's PC boards.</p>
  <p>There will be a few different simultaneous phases of the project. The three engineering sects, mechanical, electrical, and computer, will be continually designing, implementing, and integrating with one another. The client, RLE, has asked for proper documentation and periodic progress reports and demonstrations.</p>
