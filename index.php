  <p>RLE Technologies has commissioned the CSU electrical engineering department to help streamline their testing process and make it more efficient. The company has their product's PC boards fabricated offsite and delivered to be assembled. Before commencing this engineering project, the test procedure they utilized for ensuring proper quality assurance took thirty minutes for only two PC boards. This was no longer acceptable.</p>
  <p>Our team was tasked with developing a new testing procedure to ensure proper functionality for each board. The team, consisting of two mechanical engineers, two electrical engineers, and a computer engineer, will have an apparatus built for testing at least two of their flagship product's PC boards.</p>
